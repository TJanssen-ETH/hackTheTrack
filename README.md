# hackTheTrack

**hackTheTrack** is a project developed by the Institute for Transport Planning and Systems (IVT) at ETH Zurich, focusing on optimizing public transportation systems through advanced algorithms and data analysis.

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase and resources for the DISPLIB 2025 Train Dispatching Competition, which challenges participants to develop real-time train dispatching algorithms. The competition aims to advance the state-of-the-art in train dispatching and contribute to more environmentally friendly transportation solutions. 

## Features

- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implementation of cutting-edge algorithms for real-time train dispatching.
- **Data Analysis**: Tools for analyzing transportation data to improve system efficiency.
- **Simulation Tools**: Simulation environments to test and validate dispatching strategies.
